        "description": "Ethiopia has not yet started the traditional process of structural transformation. A key source of economic growth, this process reallocates economic activity from low to high productivity sectors. It broadly moves activities out of agriculture into textiles, followed by electronics and/or machinery manufacturing. Global market share in textile exports in Ethiopia has stagnated over the previous decade; electronics and machinery have yet to take-off in Ethiopia, limiting its income growth."
