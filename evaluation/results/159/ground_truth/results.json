        "description": "Turkiye has started the process of structural transformation. A key source of economic growth, this process reallocates economic activity from low to high productivity sectors. It broadly moves activities out of agriculture into textiles, followed by electronics and/or machinery manufacturing. While Turkiye has a presence in textile exports, its global market share in electronics has stagnated over the previous decade."
