        "description": "Spain has completed the process of structural transformation, having entered all major, high-productivity sectors. However, global market share in machinery manufacturing, in Spain, has stagnated over the previous decade. Spain's export growth in the past five years has been driven by Services. Spain's growth in Services has not been by good luck, by simply concentrating in a growing global sector. Rather, export growth in Services has been driven by expanding its global market share."
